keep in mind that .gitignore will not ignore files that have already been committed to a repository. 
If you want to ignore a file that is already tracked by Git, you will need to delete the file from your repository and then add it to your .gitignore file.

Unstage changes (if not committed yet):
If you've made changes but haven't committed them yet, and you want to undo those changes and revert your files to their state at the last commit, 
you can use the following command:
git reset --hard
This command will remove all changes since the last commit and reset your working directory to match the last committed

Discard changes to specific files:
If you want to discard changes to specific files and revert them to their state at the last commit,
 you can use the following command:
 git checkout -- <file>
 Replace <file> with the name of the file you want to revert. This command will discard any changes made to that file since the last commit.
