What is serializable in java and  class can be serialized what does it mean, when & why we should do this


In Java, serialization refers to the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can then be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. This byte stream contains the object's data as well as information about the object's type and the types of its instance variables
To make a class serializable in Java, you need to implement the java.io.Serializable interface. 
 This interface acts as a marker interface, meaning it doesn't contain any methods. Instead, its presence indicates to the Java runtime that instances of the class can be serialized.

Here's an example of a class implementing Serializable:

import java.io.Serializable;

public class MyClass implements Serializable {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    
    // constructor, getters, setters...
}

When should you serialize an object? There are several scenarios

Persistence: You might want to save the state of an object to a file or a database so that it can be retrieved later.
             For example, saving user preferences in an application or storing game state in a video game.
            
Communication: If you need to send objects across a network, 
               serialization allows you to convert them into a format that can be transmitted efficiently.

Caching: Sometimes it's beneficial to cache objects to improve performance.
        Serialization allows you to store objects in a serialized form and later deserialize them when needed.

Deep Copying: Serialization can be used to create deep copies of objects by serializing them and then deserializing them. 
              This process effectively creates a new instance of the object with the same state as the original


note:- However, it's essential to be cautious when serializing objects, especially in distributed systems or when dealing with sensitive data, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities if not done properly. 
       Additionally, not all objects can be serialized, such as objects that contain non-serializable fields or objects with transient fields.
